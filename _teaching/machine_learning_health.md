I conceptualized the course content and I was involved in evaluation of the final course project.
Furthermore, supervised the practical tutorials where students get the chance to work with real medical data made available by the Amsterdam UMC. 
Lastly, I gave a lecture discussing uncertainty quantification and advanced XAI methods.
