Conceptualized the course content, involved in evaluation of the final course project.
Furthermore, supervised the practical tutorials where students get the chance to work with real medical data made available by the Amsterdam UMC. 
Lastly, I give a lecture discussing uncertainty quantification and advanced XAI methods especially relevant for applications in the health domain.
