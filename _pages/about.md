I am a second-year PhD student in the Quantitative Data Analytics group, supervised by Mark Hoogendoorn & Shujian Yu, at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My PhD project is part of the [Stress-in-Action](https://stress-in-action.nl/) project which aims at utilizing big data and machine learning to advance stress research. In particular, I am interested in topics
related to trustworthy AI, efficient deep learning and probabilistic machine learning. Prior to this position, I worked as a lecturer at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and completed a MSc in Data Science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain and a MSc in Economics at Lund University, Sweden.
